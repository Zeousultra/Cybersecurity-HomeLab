# Cybersecurity HomeLab

## Overview
This project documents my journey in setting up a cybersecurity home lab using VMware Workstation 15 Player. The lab consists of multiple virtual machines, a firewall, a vulnerability scanner, and a SIEM system. It serves as a hands-on environment to practice security concepts, penetration testing, and system administration.

## Components

### 1. Installing Windows 10 Image
- Download Windows 10 Enterprise VM from Microsoft.
- Install and configure the VM for domain integration.
